### Contribute a Stack

We encourage the developer community to contribute to the stack. 
Following are the steps that will help to do the same.

1. **Create github repository with the following structure.**

   The github structure defines:

   a. Tutorials

   b. Architecture/Overview

   c. Configurations

   This json file defines all the information specific to the stack:

   a. Commands - Defines the descriptions and the commands that needs to be executed to deploy the stack.

   b. Tutorials - Developers user guide that provides information on:

      - How to use the stack.
      
      - Understand the stack composition/architecture.
  
      - How to deploy the stack, if user wishes to deploy manually.
